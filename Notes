- Problem
    * Technology, like machine learning, can be incredibly helpful in forecasting how sports teams will do when pitted
    against each other. Create a program that uses past team data to make a prediction on how each team will perform
    this season.

- Output
    * Results of each team's home games
    * Each teams wins and losses for the season

- Requirements
    * Create a Team class with:
        * The team's name, total wins, total losses, season wins and season losses stored as attributes
        * A method that takes a competing team, simulates who will win the match and updates each team's wins and losses accordingly
        * A method that displays their name and current season's wins and losses
    * Use each row of data in team_history.csv to create a new Team instance
    * Have each Team instance compete against every other team and display who won (This means that each team will face each other twice)
    * Display each team's wins and losses for the season
